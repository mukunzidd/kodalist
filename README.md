_For Developers_

## What am I building?
I am building a FORUM for  Developers. a place where they will be able to talk to each other, help each other via threads about various subjects, and have a one one message just in case they are interested.

## Who am I building it for?
- Young Developers in the region
- People who are teaching themselves how to code
- Experienced developers in the region
- Everyone else who wants to get into the conversation
- Site visitors


## Why am I building it?
I want to create a presence of programmers in Rwanda. I want to find people who have the same dreams as I do, and feel that I am not the only one. I want Zee to be the place to be to develop yourself as a developer and meet other awesome people, and share experiences... I don't want young programmers to suffer the same struggle I'd faced when starting out.

## What are the key features do I need it to have?
- User Authentication
- Many categories for threads (Rails, Ruby, PHP, MySQL, Postgres, Node.JS, Angular, MongoDB)
- There are many categories
- User can create a thread
- User can reply to a thread
- User can up/downvote a thread
- User can reply to a reply
- User can send a message to another user
- User can reply to a message from another user
- Markdown  and code highlighting for users to be able to post quickly and highlighting in threads and replies
- **_GitHub Profile Finder_** to search github users and repos(with Github API)
